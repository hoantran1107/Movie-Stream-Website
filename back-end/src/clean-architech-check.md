I'll analyze your source code to evaluate if it follows clean architecture principles. Let me start by examining the project structure and the currently open file.

## Clean Architecture Analysis

After examining your Movie Stream Website backend, here's my assessment of whether it follows **100% clean architecture**:

### ‚úÖ **What's Done Well**

1. **Correct Layer Structure**: You have the proper 4-layer structure:
   - `Movie.Domain` (Core/Entities)
   - `Movie.Application` (Use Cases/Abstractions)
   - `Movie.Infrastructure` (Data Access/External Services)
   - `Movie.API` (Presentation/Controllers)

2. **Dependency Flow**: The dependencies flow correctly inward:

   ```
   Movie.Domain ‚Üê Movie.Application ‚Üê Movie.Infrastructure
                                   ‚Üê Movie.API
   ```

3. **Repository Pattern**: Proper implementation with interfaces in Application layer and concrete implementations in Infrastructure.

4. **Dependency Injection**: Good DI setup with `DependencyInjectionExtension`.

### ‚ùå **Missing Clean Architecture Elements**

**This is NOT 100% clean architecture** due to several critical gaps:

#### 1. **Anemic Domain Layer**

- Your domain entities are just data containers without business logic
- Missing domain services, value objects, and aggregates
- No business rules or domain validation

```csharp
// Current: Anemic entity
public class MovieItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; } = default!;
    // ... just properties
}
```

#### 2. **Thin Application Layer**

- No use cases or command/query handlers
- Missing application services
- No business orchestration logic
- Only has DTOs and repository abstractions

#### 3. **Missing Key Patterns**

- **CQRS**: No separation of commands and queries
- **Mediator Pattern**: No use of MediatR or similar
- **Validation**: No input validation or business rule validation
- **Domain Events**: No event handling mechanism

#### 4. **Infrastructure Concerns in Wrong Layer**

- Entity Framework configurations should be in Infrastructure, but domain entities should be framework-agnostic

#### 5. **Incomplete Implementation**

- Only template `WeatherForecastController` exists
- No actual movie-related business functionality
- Missing authentication/authorization logic

### üéØ **To Achieve 100% Clean Architecture**

You need to add:

1. **Rich Domain Models** with business logic
2. **Application Services** with use cases (CreateMovie, GetMovieBySlug, etc.)
3. **Command/Query Handlers** using CQRS pattern
4. **Domain Events** for cross-cutting concerns
5. **Validation Layer** for business rules
6. **Value Objects** for domain concepts
7. **Actual Controllers** that implement movie functionality

### **Current Status: ~60% Clean Architecture**

While you have the foundation right with proper layering and dependency direction, you're missing the core business logic and use case implementations that make clean architecture valuable. The structure is there, but the architectural patterns and business logic are largely missing.

Would you like me to help you implement some of these missing patterns to move closer to 100% clean architecture?
